	<h2 align="left">What is TfCD?</h2>
	<p align="justify">TfCD stands for &quot;<strong>Time for CD</strong>&quot; and is a popular arrangement between models and photographers on the internet. The basic idea is that no money changes hands, but both sides benefit from the arrangement. Both, the model and the photographer, will sign a TfCD contract before the shooting starts. The model will receive a CD/DVD containing the photographs after the shooting. These photographs can then be used  for prints, displaying on a website or use for her/his sedcard. The photographer in turn can display the photographs on his website.  Model and photographer may not use the photographs for any commercial use.</p>
	<h2>Interested in a TfCD shooting?</h2>
	<p>Did you already have a look at my   portrait <a href="javascript:showGallery('gallery.php?pic=x&cat=portrait')">portfolio</a>?</p>
	<p align="justify">Please get in <a href="imprint.html" target="_parent">contact</a> with me if you're interested in a TfCD photo shooting. To discuss the details of the shooting  (location, date &amp; time, kind of photos, outfit,  companion?) we should schedule a first meeting before the date of the actual shooting. Please review the below linked TfCD contract to be clear about  the details of the shooting. This contract is to make sure that both of us are in agreement on the outcome of the shooting and to commit on the legal agreements (rights &amp; responsibilities of model and photographer).</p>
	<p>To open/print the TfCD contract you  need to have the Adobe PDF Reader installed (can be downloaded as free software from <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">www.adobe.com</a>)</p>
